## [Climate Migration](https://m2ia72.github.io/ClimateMigration/V3.1.16/index)
Many papers claimed that the number of climate migrants will reach 143 million in 2050. This number was first enunciate in a report of the World Bank Group named "Groundswell, preparing for internal climate migration" which forecast the numbers of migrants for three parts of the world, South Asia, Central and South America, and Africa.

The report explains that climate change and disaster will have a heavy impact on the migratory flux. It predicts three scenarios more or less optimistic in function of our implication to protect the environment.
We decided to draw a visualization to show what this number really means.
